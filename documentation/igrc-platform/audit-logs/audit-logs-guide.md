# How to Use Audit Logs

Audit logs are accessible to authorized users and can be searched according to different criteria directly from the web interface. The search results provide comprehensive information on the actions taken.
This is a typical audit log multi-criteria search page:

![Audit Log](../audit-logs/images/1.png "Audit Log")

Audit logs can also be used as a data source to consolidate Usage metrics in the Identity Ledger.
Identity Ledger's Usage metrics allow aggregating audit log events and correlating them to Identity Ledger elements (organizations, people, etc.) to provide powerful analytics such as the following:   

- Are there people who are not part of the HR department and who accessed sensitive HR data on SharePoint?
- Are there people who are not part of the IT support team and who connected during the week end to reset passwords?
- Are there traders who came in trading during their holidays?
- Are there toxic permission combinations who were actually used during the last period (such as payment fraud pattern)?
- Which transactions/permissions are never used?
- Which accounts are never used?

Usage metrics are leveraged in Brainwave's User Behavior Analytics in order to help you "find the needle in the haystack" and identify abnormal behaviors through peer groups analysis.   

This chapter explains how to configure, collect and work with Audit Logs in Brainwave's solutions.
