# Assigning a reliability index to a reconciliation rule

Assigning a **reliability index**  to a reconciliation rule that has a value of between 1 and 5. This value represents the confidence that we have in the reconciliations found by the rule.     
For example, a rule based on a non-ambiguous criterion such as a person's email or unique id, which is usually unique, can be considered as having maximum reliability. Conversely, a rule based on an account reconciliation of another repository, or on a less deterministic rule such as the three first letters of the surname, presents a greater risk of errors or false positives; these will be assigned a less reliable index.

It should be noted that a reliability index is automatically assigned to rules generated by the rule creation wizard. It is of course possible to edit it afterwards.   

**Example of use:** Every quarter you launch a reconciliation review to individually validate all the reconciliations which have a reliability index of less than 3 (out of 5). 

# Executing reconciliation rules by default

It is possible to execute reconciliation rules on all of your repositories. To do this you define a joker `*` in the reconciliation policy. It is, however, advised to perform this operation in the final position if you also want to execute other rules on each of your repositories, as shown in the screenshot below.

# Executing reconciliation rules on all repositories

If you have many account repositories, the reconciliation engine allows you to execute the reconciliation rules on all your repositories in one step.   
For example, if you have two repositories, `AD_admin` and `AD_users`, you can put a joker `*`  after the AD prefix as shown in the screenshot below (`AD*`).

# Not examining deactivated accounts in the reconciliation policy

If you wish to speed up the processing of the reconciliation policy, it is possible to only take into account active accounts, so that there is no systematic attempt to reconcile deactivated accounts. This is done in the policy settings tab, in the left panel, by changing the option **Active only**  to `true`.

This option makes it possible to improve the performance of the reconciliation processing; it is not advised for general use but for use only in specific situations where the number of irreconcilable inactive accounts is particularly high and greatly increases the time it takes to process the policy.
