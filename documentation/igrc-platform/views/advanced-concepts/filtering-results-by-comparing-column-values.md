It is possible to filter results, using other columns rather than static values as the basis for the comparison.     
The configuration principle is similar to the principle described [here](igrc-platform/views/filtering-results.md).  

To carry out a comparison by column values, simply use the "Attribute name" field rather than "global parameter" or "value" fields.
