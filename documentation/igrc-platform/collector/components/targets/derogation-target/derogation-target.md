# Error handling

If permission cannot be found in the import tables, the creation of derogation object is silently cancelled and a line is written to the log file:  
```
No writing of derogation because the permission (...)
contains an unknown value in the databasein the database
```

If one of the key attributes (application or permission) is empty, the creation of this derogation object is silently cancelled and a line is written to the log file:
```
No writing of derogation because one of the key attributes
is empty or missing in the target component configuration
```
