![Due date](../../time-management/images/dueDate.png "Due date")   

There is a field named **'Due date'** in the Activity tab of a manual task or the process start task (see caption). This value is NOT related to the task expiration that is set in the Role / Reminder tab as explained in the following page: [Reminders, Escalation and task expiration](igrc-platform/workflow/time-management/reminder-escalation-task-expiration.md).   

The due date will not be used during the process execution, and is in no way a constraint on the process execution. It only serves documentation purposes, and is available for reporting or displayed in process administration.   

The due date of a start task indicates an estimated due date of the process, whereas, the due date of a manual task that of the task itself.
