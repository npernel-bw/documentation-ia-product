Pages is the Brainwave data visualization technology that leverages the Identity Ledger data through the web portal.   
Through this technology, you can declare your own dashboards, analytics, forms or workflows GUIs in the web portal.   
A Page can be as simple as a 1 KPI dashboard or as rich as the Workflow Task Manager.   
All the web portal interfaces are provided as Pages along with their .sources!

# Things you need to know

- Pages in the project are located under **/webportal/pages**
- Pages are defined in ".page" files
- As a best practice, 1 file should contain only 1 page
- Pages are part of your project and will be part of the exported .war file
- This export behaviour can be customized in the technical configuration
