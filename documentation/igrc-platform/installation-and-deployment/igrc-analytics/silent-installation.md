# Procedure

Once the executable is downloaded, open a command prompt (as an **administrator**) then navigate to the folder where the `exe` is located.  

The command to run is:  
`<executable-file> /S /D=<installation-folder>`  

Where:    

 * `<executable-file>`: name of the downloaded file (for example: `iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_2016-R3-SP5_2017-04-12.exe`)  
 * `/S`: Silent installation option  
 * `/D=`: Directory where to install iGRC Analytics  

# Example

# Scripting recommendation

By default, the silent procedure executes the iGRC Analytics installation in background mode.

If needed, the script can be executed in background mode, using a PowerShell console. Here is the way to manage that:

```powershell  
$INSTALL = "iGRCAnalyticsSetup_win32_x64_2016-R3-SP5_2017-04-12.exe"
$INSTALLDIR = "C:/igrc/"
$expression = "Start-Process -Wait -FilePath $INSTALL -ArgumentList `"/S /D=$INSTALLDIR`""
Invoke-Expression $expression
```

Where:  

 * `$INSTALL`: path to the iGCR Analytics binary  
 * `/S`: Silent installation option  
 * `/D`: Installation folder option  
 * `$INSTALLDIR`: Directory where to install iGRC Analytics
