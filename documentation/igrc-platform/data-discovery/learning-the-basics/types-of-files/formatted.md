Formatted files are often text report type files from centralized sites (Mainframe). They don't contain separators; fields are identified by their position (characters 1 to 8 = field 1, characters 9 to 15 = field 2...)

**_Selecting FORMATTED file template_**    

Once the FORMATTED wizard has been selected and the file chosen, a wizard displays the various options.

**_Import of the Formatted file being processed_**  

It is possible to specify:   

- the file encoding
- the separation character used for multivalued attributes
- whether the file contains a header line with column names
- whether it needs to skip X lines before starting to process the file
- whether only certain rows of the file should be taken into account. Filtering is then performed with a regular expression. This setting may be useful in the case of a "dump" file from a central site that contains many elements of a varying nature.   

If you wish to adjust the column selection, just place the cursor in the right spot in the preview area, and then click on the "Set/Remove a Separation" button.
