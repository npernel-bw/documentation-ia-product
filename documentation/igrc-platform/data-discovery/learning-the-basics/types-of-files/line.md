LINE type discovery allows the analysis of log files.

![Line file](igrc-platform/data-discovery/learning-the-basics/types-of-files/images/1-line.png "Line file")   
**_Selecting a LINE file template_**     

Once the LINE wizard has been selected and the file chosen, a wizard appears. This wizard allows you to:    

- Select the file encoding type
- Indicate whether you wish to ignore empty lines
- Indicate whether it should skip X lines before beginning the file analysis

**_Import of the LINE file being processed_**   

A LINE type discovery loads the lines in a single attribute named "line." The true analysis of this line is then performed with actions like "Extract the characters into a new attribute," which will go through the line and extract the information in typed attributes.

**_Overview of the LINE file attribute_**    

We invite you to consult the "screencasts" of examples on [http://expert-exchange.brainwavegrc.com](http://expert-exchange.brainwavegrc.com/). They illustrate in particular how the log files are analyzed with this discovery.
