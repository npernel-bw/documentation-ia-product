CSV discovery allows the analysis of files whose data are separated by a character (",", ";"...)   

The CSV format is specified in the RFC 4180, but CSV discovery is also able to analyze files that don't correspond to the specification as long as they contain separators.

**_Selecting CSV template for a new CSV discovery_**    

Once the CSV format has been selected and the file chosen, file analysis configuration is automatically suggested. These settings may be changed if needed:   

- File encoding format
- Column separators
- Multivalued value separator
- Text value separator
- Indicate whether the file contains a header with column names or not
- Ignore the X first lines before starting the file analysis.
