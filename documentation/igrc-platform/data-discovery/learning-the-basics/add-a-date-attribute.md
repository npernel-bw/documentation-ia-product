Adding a Date attribute gives two choices :

- **Adding the current date**   

For this option, the attribute will contain the date when it has been computed. It could be useful if you need to show the exact loading date of the data.

- **Adding the last modified date of the file**   

Choosing this will create an attribute with the source file's last modification date.

Please note that these attributes will not show up in the attributes list, but you will see their value in the "Results" block on the upper right side of the Analysis screen.   

Here are the results you will get:
